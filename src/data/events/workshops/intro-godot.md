    bio: I was born and raised close enough to Lisboa to appreciate the background noise of cars, yet far enough to know how to milk a cow. After learning how to do all sorts of useful things like making bread, managing a small music newspaper, raiding a 40 man in Vanilla WoW and being involved in student politics, I graduated in psychology. It was the blossoming of my interest in the mind, art and technology that led me to pursue graduate training at the Systems Neuroscience lab where, today, I study human behaviour and condition through novel paradigms in the form of videogames.

    description: The Computer Graphics and Multimedia Student Group has historically focused on the field of game development, having over the last few years expanded its sphere of interests to include some of the many facets of Multimedia. As of today, we organise the monthly Game Dev Meet @ Porto and have participated in the Global Game Jam (a game oriented hackathon) as a Jam Site for 3 consecutive years. In addition to events related to game development, we also hold workshops spanning a range of topics relevant to the group’s identity, approaching tools such as Blender and Unity. Ultimately, we seek to offer the general public activities that stimulate the growth of multimedia and game development domains on a national level.

Introduction to the Godot game engine, divided into three sections: a brief presentation conducted by the instructor and a showcase of some of his past projects, an overview of the basic workflow of the engine and development of a simple game and, lastly, a short discussion on possible open-source development paths. We’re aiming for the workshop to be as accessible as possible; however, some programming knowledge is advised. The participants will have to provide for their own tools, namely a laptop (the engine will be installed during the workshop, given the frequent updates it is subjected to - the file is approximately 30MB).
