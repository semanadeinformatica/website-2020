In this workshop you can test your skills in hacking modern web applications against the OWASP Juice Shop! There are 85+ hacking challenges that are waiting to be solved, ranging from simple functional problems and the usual XSS/SQLi issues over severe authentication flaws up to multi-step and multi-path attacks!

The workshop will consist of multiple short teasers to specific vulnerabilities and time for hacking! You can then stick to the teasered topic or go into free-roaming mode and just try to beat as many challenges as possible. Your pace is entirely up to you! Some of the more mindboggling challenges can optionally be tackled in a “swarm-hacking” style together on the big screen. Over the entire duration of the training you can get first-hand hints by the creator of the Juice Shop in case you get stuck on any challenge.

Please bring the following prerequisites to this workshop:

- Laptop with your favourite Internet browser
- Some API testing app like PostMan (optional)
- Any pentesting toys and tools you like (optional)
