Building a product and making the produt grow and evolve differs a lot from what's taught in courses and lectured in classes.
More than engineering skills it requires a lot of communication, ownership and leadership skills.
In this talk we'll discuss how is to work for an IT company, what drives change, what drives product, what drives engineering and ultimately what should you know before you start your engineering career.
