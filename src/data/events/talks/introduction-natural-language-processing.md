In this talk, we'll see how computers can understand text by learning about modern concepts in Natural Language Processing such as representation learning and recurrent neural networks. We'll show you the basics behind the tasks of text classification, information extraction, machine translation and dialog systems. We will also cover some Python text processing libraries and how you can start building your next NLP project.
